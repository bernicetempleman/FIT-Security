This directory contains the examples from Java Cryptography.

Because the United States limits the export of
cryptographic software, many of the examples from
the book could not be placed on this ftp site.
For a complete list of the examples that are
not here, see the accompanying document
examples.txt or examples.pdf.

Examples with no explicit package are placed in a directory
with the same name as the chapter title. For example, the
Masher example from the first chapter is in the
directory named Introduction.

Examples which belong to a particular package can be
found in the appropriate place in the oreilly
directory. For instance, the source code for the
oreilly.jonathan.crypto.ElGamalKeyPair class is
found in oreilly/jonathan/crypto/ElGamalKeyPair.java.

Some of the chapter directories also contain
a source file called Shorts.java. This contains
all of the short code fragments for that
chapter.

If you have any problems with the examples, write
to bookquestions@oreilly.com.
